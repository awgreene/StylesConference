# Welcome
In this tutorial I followed the directions outlined by [Shay Howe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) to create a mock website for a Styles Conference held in Chicago.

# Why I Completed the Tutorial
With a history of backend development roles, I came to realize that to become a better engineer I needed to learn more about frontend development. To most individuals, the frontend is the product, and I was always nervous about sharing examples of my work publicly because of my limited frontend development skills. After hearing about [Brandon Morelli](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer)'s experience, I decided that it was about time I learn more about frontend development.

# Overall Impression of this Tutorial
Shay did an incredible job explaining why each step was performed as we created the Website. By the end of the tutorial, I was surprised how a series of simple steps could lead to such an impressive website. Prior to this tutorial, I had always relied on framework tools such as bootstrap to create presentable frontends, but I lacked the confidence to create a site using only HTML and CSS. As I relied more and more on these powerful tools, the idea of creating a website without them became more and more implausible to me. After completing this course, I have newfound appreciation for HTML and CSS and I look forward to working with them more in the future.
